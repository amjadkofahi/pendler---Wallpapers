## How to contribute to Ruby on Rails

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability
  in Rails**, and instead reach out to us.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/moutasem1989/pendler---Wallpapers/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/moutasem1989/pendler---Wallpapers/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* For more detailed information on submitting a bug report and creating an issue, visit our [reporting guidelines](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/contributing_to_ruby_on_rails.html#reporting-an-issue).

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to pendler wallpaper](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
