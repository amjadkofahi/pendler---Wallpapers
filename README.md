 ## to do:
 - Port to Android.
 - Provide PInvoke for [libheif](https://github.com/strukturag/libheif) library to encode and decode HEIF images. The DLL must be [supported by the Microsoft Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/win32-and-com/alternatives-to-windows-apis-uwp)
 
 
 
 
 # Download the app from the Microsoft Store
 the Microsoft Store copy do not contain the HEIC decoder functionality because [Magick.NET](https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET) do not use supported APIs by the Microsoft Store.
